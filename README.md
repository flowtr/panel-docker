# Docker Dashboard Example

This is the code repository for the "Create a Docker dashboard with Typescript, React and Socket.io" article on Auth0.

## Prerequisites

**Node 14.x**

**pnpm package manager** (`npm i -g pnpm`)

Clone the project, then run:

```
pnpm install
```

The sample interacts with Docker, so having the [native Docker tools](https://www.docker.com/) for your OS is required
for the sample to be of any use.

## Running the sample

```
pnpm run start
```
